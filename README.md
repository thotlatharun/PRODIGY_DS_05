# 🚗 Traffic Accident Data Analysis (US Accidents Dataset)

## 📄 Overview
This project analyzes **U.S. traffic accident data (2016–2023)** to uncover patterns related to **road conditions, weather, and time of day**.  
Using Python and visualization tools, we explore accident trends and visualize accident hotspots across different cities and states.

## 🧾 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset and inspect missing values, data types, and overall structure.

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Remove columns with too many missing values.
- Convert date columns and extract features such as year, month, day, and hour.

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze accident frequency by **hour, day of the week, and month**.
- Study relationships between **weather conditions, visibility, and severity**.

### 4️⃣ Visualization
- Create interactive and static plots:
  - Accident counts by time and day
  - Weather and severity correlation
  - Accident hotspot maps using Plotly and Folium

### 5️⃣ Insights
- Most accidents occur during **rush hours (7–9 AM & 4–6 PM)**.
- **Fridays and weekends** show higher accident frequency.
- **Rain, fog, and low visibility** increase accident severity.
- Hotspots cluster near **urban centers** (e.g., Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston).
